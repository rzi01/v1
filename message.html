    I want to just say a couple things about how I feel about you when I first saw you on the third floor library. There was just something about you that caught my eye and I was so mesmerized by you the way you talked, and the way you carried yourself as if there was something calling me towards you. And this semester again when we talked the first day after you came back in the lounge, there was just this connection right away like we hit it off and it just felt right and I don’t know I just kept getting drawn to you more and more and that’s why I texted you. And over the last week after all of our conversations and learning so much about you I think I’m slowly starting to understand the reason behind why I was mesmerized. It’s because who you are as a person you’re so kind and mature, and those are very surface level things someone could say when I say you’re kind, I mean you care about others more than you care about yourself a lot of the time, and when I say you’re mature, I think that you were forced to grow up and that is a good thing, but it also has its bad things. I think it was your smile that made me really stop standing on business because it seems so peaceful like when I’m looking at your smile, everything around me is like I’m in a fairytale where there are no stress or the pressure of life. And I want to get to know that smile more. I am sorry if this is cringy but this is I wanted to tell you.
